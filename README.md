# Dojo Battle Ship
---
## Description
A remake of the classic two person strategy game. Started during MEAN stack project week at Coding Dojo in order to explore the use of sockets. 

## Concept
Allow two players to connect from different clients. Allow the users to deploy their ships (set their grid) by dragging and dropping 'ships'. During game play show two grids to players: 1) Displays players grid with markings of where their ships are. 2) A firing grid where a player selects a square to 'fire' upon. Both grids will reflect which locations have been targeted. Game ends when one players has successfully targeted in full the opponents ships.
